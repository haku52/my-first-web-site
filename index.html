  <p><strong>small gift, big smileÂ®</strong><br>
  It's more than just a catchy phrase; it's the foundation of everything we do, and we're proud to say we've been creating smiles for over 40 years.<br>
  At Sanrio, we believe that a gift is more than just a gift. Rather, a gift is a means of expressing our heartfelt feelings for others. This philosophy guides all of our activities, whether we're designing a stationery set, a retail store, or an animated television series.<br>
  From Sanrio boutiques showcasing the ultimate Sanrio collection to smaller assortments in other shopping environments, we invite all our friends and guests to experience the magic of these four simple words.<br></p>
